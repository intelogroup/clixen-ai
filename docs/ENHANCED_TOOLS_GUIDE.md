# Enhanced N8N Workflows with Multi-Tool AI Agents

## üõ†Ô∏è Configured Tools & APIs

Your n8n instance now has access to a comprehensive toolkit for building powerful AI agents:

### AI Models
- **OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-4-Turbo** - Advanced reasoning and content generation
- **DeepSeek** - Technical analysis and code understanding  
- **Google Gemini Pro** - Multi-modal AI and synthesis
- **Claude (via API)** - Coming soon

### Data Sources & Tools
- **Apify** - Web scraping and data extraction
- **Firecrawl** - Advanced web content crawling
- **OpenWeather** - Real-time weather data
- **Google APIs** - Search, Drive, Gmail integration

## üöÄ Enhanced Workflows

### 1. Multi-Tool AI Agent (`/multi-tool-agent`)

**Capabilities:**
- Intelligent tool selection based on query analysis
- Weather data integration
- Web scraping with Firecrawl
- Search and research with Apify
- Multi-model AI synthesis

**Example Requests:**
```json
{
  "query": "What's the weather in Tokyo and find recent articles about climate change?"
}
```

**Workflow Flow:**
1. Intent extraction with GPT-4
2. Parallel tool execution (weather/scraping/search)
3. Data synthesis and response generation

### 2. Research Analyst Agent (`/research-analyst`)

**Capabilities:**
- Multi-model research analysis
- Deep web content extraction
- Cross-model consensus building
- Comprehensive report generation

**Example Requests:**
```json
{
  "topic": "Quantum Computing Breakthroughs 2024",
  "depth": "comprehensive",
  "focus_areas": ["hardware", "software", "applications"]
}
```

**Workflow Flow:**
1. Research planning with GPT-4
2. Parallel data collection (Apify + Firecrawl)
3. Multi-model analysis (GPT-4 + DeepSeek + Gemini)
4. Final synthesis and report generation

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Tool Connectivity
```bash
# Test all API connections
node scripts/test-enhanced-workflows.js connectivity
```

### Test Individual Workflows
```bash
# Test multi-tool agent
node scripts/test-enhanced-workflows.js multi-tool

# Test research analyst
node scripts/test-enhanced-workflows.js research

# Performance benchmarking
node scripts/test-enhanced-workflows.js performance
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
# Run all enhanced workflow tests
node scripts/test-enhanced-workflows.js
```

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Multi-Tool Agent
- **Average Response Time:** 3-8 seconds (depending on tools used)
- **Concurrent Capacity:** 5-10 requests
- **Tool Selection Accuracy:** ~90%+

### Research Analyst
- **Average Response Time:** 15-30 seconds
- **Report Quality:** Multi-model consensus
- **Data Sources:** 3+ per research task

## üîß Configuration

All API keys are configured in `.env`:

```bash
# AI Models
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...

# External Tools
APIFY_API_TOKEN=apify_api_...
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=a286...

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=680091807004-...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-...
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### Business Intelligence
- Market research with multi-source data
- Competitive analysis with web scraping
- Weather impact on business operations

### Technical Research
- Technology trend analysis
- Multi-model consensus on technical topics
- Deep technical documentation extraction

### Content Creation
- Research-backed content generation
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Real-time data integration

## üö® Important Notes

### Activation Required
Workflows must be manually activated in the n8n UI:
1. Go to https://clixen.app.n8n.cloud
2. Open each workflow
3. Toggle the "Active" switch
4. Save the workflow

### Rate Limits
- **OpenAI:** Standard API limits
- **Apify:** Based on your subscription
- **Firecrawl:** 500 requests/month (free tier)
- **OpenWeather:** 1000 requests/day (free tier)

### Cost Optimization
- Monitor token usage across models
- Cache frequently requested data
- Use appropriate model for task complexity

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Test Results Location
```
/data/output/enhanced-workflow-test-[timestamp].json
```

### Key Metrics
- Response latency per tool
- Success rate by workflow
- Token usage by model
- Tool selection accuracy

## üîÑ Workflow Deployment

### Import Enhanced Workflows
```bash
# Deploy all enhanced workflows
node scripts/import-workflow.js

# Or deploy specific workflow
cp workflows/core/05-enhanced-multi-tool-agent.json /tmp/
node scripts/import-workflow.js /tmp/05-enhanced-multi-tool-agent.json
```

### Validate Before Deployment
```bash
npm run validate
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Tool not responding"**
- Check API key configuration
- Verify tool connectivity with `connectivity` test
- Check rate limits

**"Workflow inactive"**  
- Manually activate in n8n UI
- Check webhook registration

**"Timeout errors"**
- Increase timeout in workflow settings
- Optimize tool selection logic

### Debug Mode
Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in `.env` for detailed logging.

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Activate workflows** in n8n UI
2. **Test connectivity** with all tools
3. **Run sample requests** to validate functionality
4. **Monitor performance** and optimize as needed
5. **Extend with additional tools** as required
